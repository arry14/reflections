Lesson 2:

Reflect: Initialising a repository
Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   It creates a git repository where changes in repository will be tracked. The repository needs to be initialised
   to create all the meta files inside the directory, which does the work of tracking and keeping version control.

Reflect: Staging area
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
   The staging area is a part of the working directory to be considered for a commit. This gives developers additional
   control on which part of the working directory is currently being worked on. Therefore, within a large
   project, the developers can see easier which files are being worked on.

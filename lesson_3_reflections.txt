Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   A remote repository is useful for collaboration project, as the repositories could be accessed in multiple
   and separate locations. It's also useful for sharing projects with other people. Open source projects
   are kept remote so other people can access and maintain them.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
   with your remote repository?
   Because there might be some changes that have been done to the remote repository, and we want to keep the 
   local repository to have the same commits as the remote repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   Forks are clones in GitHub. It maintains the link to the original repository. Clones are its namesake: clones
   of a repository. Branches are a separate working copy of a repository. You could only see a branch within a 
   repository. Forks are to be used if I want to use someone else's work, and tweak it for my own use. The link
   to the original repository is maintained for all to see.
